man formats and displays the on-line manual pages.  
--------------------------------------------------
If you specify section, man only looks in  that  section  of the manual.  name is normally the name of the manual page, which is typically the name of a command, function, or file.  However, if name contains a slash (/) then man interprets it as a file specification, so that you can do man ./foo.5 or even man /cd/foo/bar.1.gz.
