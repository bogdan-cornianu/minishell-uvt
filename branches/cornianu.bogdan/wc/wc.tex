WC - print newline, word, and byte counts for an opened or text from
stdin file

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WC begins by reading the arguments list. If a filename is not specified,
WC will ask for text to be inputed from stdin. For each possible option
there is a variable that is equal to 1 if the according option is
selected and 0 otherwise.

fp - represents the status of the opened file. If it is equal to NULL
then text will be read from stdin.

The text(either from file or from stdin) is traversed by WC and according
to the selected options, the appropiate variables are incremented
with lines count, words count, bytes count or characters count. Once
the text has been traversed, WC will display a text line containing
the results for each selected option.
