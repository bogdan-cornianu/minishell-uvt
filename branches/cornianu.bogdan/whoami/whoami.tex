WHOAMI - print effective userid

---------------------------------------------

WHOAMI uses the GETEUID and GETPWUID system calls. GETPWUID receives
as an argument the GETEUID return value.

GETEUID - returns the real user ID of the current process.

GETPWUID - returns a pointer to a structure containing the broken-out
fields of the record in the password database that matches the user
ID uid.

pwd is declared as \textbf{struct passwd {*} }and then we access the
name field by using pwd->pw\_name and we print it to the screen. The
pwd->pw\_name represents the effective userid.
