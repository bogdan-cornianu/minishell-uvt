CAT - concatenate files and print on the standard output

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CAT begins by reading the arguments list. At least a file name must
be specified. For each possible option there is a variable that is
equal to 1 if the according option is selected and 0 otherwise.

Numbering the lines - if option 'n' is selected, CAT will count the
number of occurrences for '\textbackslash{}n' and display that value
as the number of lines.

Printing version information - if option 'v' is selected, CAT will
print the version information.

Printing the help menu - if option 'h' is selected, CAT will print
a help menu with all the options available.

Show tabs - if option 'T' is selected then all occurrences of '\textbackslash{}t'
in the text will be replaced by '\textasciicircum{}I'.

Show '\$' at the end of each line - if option 'E' is selected, then
at the end of each line a '\$' character will be printed.
